### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

```swift
//Request location updates
|{ (location: CLLocation) in 

}
```
```swift
//Request .authorizedAlways permissions and only one location object
CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedAlways | { (status: CLAuthorizationStatus) in
            
} | .one { (location: CLLocation) in 

}
```

**‚ö°Ô∏è It‚Äôs possible to incapsulate whole data receiving process and memory managment duty to one symbol?**

>In Unix-like computer operating systems, a [pipeline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) is a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing. A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output text of each process (stdout) is passed directly as input (stdin) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently.

```bash
command1 | command2 | command3

ls -l | grep key | less
```

### üïπÔ∏è How to
[![How to add REST API support to Swift project](https://img.youtube.com/vi/I81GEbc1ES8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81GEbc1ES8)

```swift
//Request .authorizedWhenInUse permissions
CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedWhenInUse | { (status: CLAuthorizationStatus) in
 
}
```
```swift
//Request location updates
//Uses .startUpdatingLocation()
|{ (location: CLLocation) in 

}
```
```swift
//Request .authorizedAlways permissions and only one location object
//Uses .requestLocation() for efficient power consumption
CLAuthorizationStatus.authorizedAlways | { (status: CLAuthorizationStatus) in
            
} | .one { (location: CLLocation) in 

}
```
```swift
//Request pedometer data updates
|{ (data: CMPedometerData) in 

}
```
```swift
//Scan for a bluetooth peripherals
|{ (peripheral: CBPeripheral) in 

}
```
```swift
//Wait for a Notification
UIWindow.keyboardWillShowNotification | { (n: Notification) in
            
}
```
```swift
//Enumerate contacts
CNContact.predicateForContacts(matchingName: "John") | .every { (contact: CNContact) in
                        
}
```
```swift
//Scan a tag
|.every { (tag: NFCNDEFTag) in

}
```
```swift
//Perform face observation
URL(string: "http://example.com/image.jpg") | { (faces: [VNFaceObservation]) in

}
```
```swift
//Perform pose observation
//Wait for two persons
data | .while { (bodies: [VNHumanBodyPoseObservation]) in
    bodies < 2
}
```
```swift
//Detect shakes
|{ (motion: UIEvent.EventSubtype) in
    if motion == .motionShake {
                
    }
}

```

```swift
//Customization
let wand = |{ (hands: [VNHumanHandPoseObservation]) in

}

let request: VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest = wand.obtain()
request.maximumHandCount = 4

let preview: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer = wand.obtain()
view.layer.addSublayer(preview!)
```

### ‚ùó Error handling

```swift
//Attach Ask<Error> to the context
any | { (error: Error) in
    
}
```
```swift
//Or use the result handler
//Nil error means successed result
any | { (error: Error?) in
    
}
```

### üí° Idea
  Imagine that you have the black box that can give you an ```Any``` object.   
  You don't know what's already in the box and [what happens inside.](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming))   
      
  Ask for object that you need with |

```bash
|{ (result: Object) in
            
}
```
```bash
ingredients | { (result: Object) in
            
}
```
```bash
ingredients | .one { (t: T) in
            
} | .every { (u: U) in

} | .while { (v: V) in
  true
}
```

### ü™Ñ –°oncept

Wand started from the idea about receiving anything in most efficient way.   
Add one sign to anything and retreive the result üì¶
